      <p>1.uptime</p>
      <pre> 13:18:27 up 79 days,  1:34,  1 user,  load average: 1.26, 1.77, 2.08</pre>
      <p>13:18:27 指当前时间 up 79 days指开机运行了79天了，一般这个值越大，说明这个服务器性能越稳定, 1:34 说明运行了79天1小时34分钟</p>
      <p>1 user 指当前连接服务器的只有1个用户</p>
      <p>最重要的时这个 load average:</p>
      <p>man uptime的描述如下</p>

DESCRIPTION
       uptime gives a one line display of the following information.  The current time, how long the system has been running, how many
       users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.

       This is the same information contained in the header line displayed by w(1).

       System load averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a
       runnable  state  is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O
       access, eg waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized  for  the
       number  of CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it
       means it was idle 75% of the time.
